# bootcamp-code-quiz

## Description

- The biggest thing that motivated me for this project was to really put the Web API and all its numerous functions and methods 
  into use. Using the Web API was quite difficult for me at first and took lots of studying to get a grip on. I was hoping this project
  would help me get that understanding down and by the end of it, I definitely have a good grasp on it. I may not be using it efficiently
  here but I definitely understand what is going on now.


- A big thing I learned(and struggled with) on this project is the fact that if it is getting too difficult or I just can't get a bit of logic to work, I should take a step back, re look at the bigger picture, and determine if what I am trying to do is actually necessary or can be done a different way, or be done in a simpler way. I ran into this roadblock several times on this project, while I was stubbornly trying to get a specific thing to work, each time solving it by backing up a bit and trying to find a different way to accomplish it. At one point in particular while struggling with trying to make random questions appear(and the proper answers to the random questions), I just couldnt figure it out in the framework I built without including insane amounts of uneeded logic to sort it out, I decided this project didnt need randomness and about half way through, re wrote the entire logic that governed that part.

## Usage

Usage is simple! You will be presented with 10 questions about basic webdev/JS knowledge. Choose the correct multiple choice answer.
When you are done, you'll be able to save your initials to the local high score, and see the results of the last 10 scores of the quiz.

## Credits

HTML, CSS, Javascript, all coded from scratch.

these links helped me figure out how to put something in an object into an array. I had stored the answers to all the questions
as arrays, which were a part of an object, also inside an object. I'm sure there is other simpler ways to achieve what I did, but
I stubbornly worked through how to make that setup work and was quite proud when I did make it work. Here are the main links
that helped me immensely with figuring that out:

Fellow bootcamp student Brian Whisler, for helping me realize and figure out how to make some complicated things more easier to solve
by not making the method used in solving them,  complicated to use in the first place.

I was a bit confused on how HTML forms worked so this helped me a lot:
